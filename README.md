## Extract
Our data formats:
CSV, XLSX

## Transform
Data munging in Jupyter Notebook with Pandas.

## Load
We decided to use a relational database because the information we're gathering can be directly linked together. We have worked with MySQL and SQLITE in this course but chose SQLITE because we're working remotely/separately and its single-file storage format makes it easy to share.
